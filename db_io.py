"""Module db_io: functions for I/O on tables and databases.

A table file has a .csv extension.

We define "table" to mean this:

    dict of {str: list of str}

Each key is a column name from the table and each value is the list of strings
in that column from top row to bottom row.

We define "database" to mean this:

    dict of {str: table}

Each key is the name of the .csv file without the extension.  Each value is
the corresponding table as defined above.
